# ami.co
This is a prototype of an application that we have designed with the idea of trying to connect university students to their fellow students in order to create meaningful friendships.

Basically you must create an account by creating a name and filling in all the blank spaces where you will be asked for personal information such as some of the personal data, hobbies, likes and some of your opinions about certain things in order to have a better idea of who that person is. This will help to find other people in the app who share similar interests for matching them, and opening the possibility of being able to contact between each other through a chat.

As we have mentioned before, Our goal with this application is that university students can forge new friendships, with which this app would help those who register with an account to at least meet new people.
